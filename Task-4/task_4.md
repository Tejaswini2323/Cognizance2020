#Global warming

*Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface. Normally, this radiation would escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the **greenhouse effect***

##Causes of Global warming

***Water vapor**: The most abundant greenhouse gas, but importantly, it acts as a feedback to the climate. Water vapor increases as the Earth's atmosphere warms, but so does the possibility of clouds and precipitation.

***Carbondioxide**(CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration by 47% since the Industrial Revolution began. 

***Methane**. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. 

***Nitrous oxide**. A powerful greenhouse gas produced by soil cultivation practices, especially the use of commercial and organic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid production, and biomass burning.

***Chlorofluorocarbons** (CFCs). Synthetic compounds entirely of industrial origin used in a number of applications, but now largely regulated in production and release to the atmosphere by international agreement for their ability to contribute to destruction of the ozone layer. They are also greenhouse gases

| Name of oxides  | Percentage in atmosphere|
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| Nitrous oxide   | 6%                      |
| Methane         | 10%                     |
|Carbondioxide    | 82%                     |
|Fluorinated gases| 3%                      |

##Effects of Global warming:
**Global warming stresses ecosystems through temperature rises, water shortages, increased fire threats, drought, weed and pest invasions, intense storm damage and salt invasion, just to name a few. Some of Australia's great natural icons, such as the Great Barrier Reef, are already threatened.**

Despite political controversy about climate change, a major report released Sept. 27, 2013, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that scientists are more certain than ever of the link between human activities and global warming. More than 197 international scientific organizations agree that global warming is real and has been caused by human action.
#PRECAUTIONS TO BE TAKEN
1. Reduce, Reuse, Recycle
2. Use Less Heat and Air Conditioning
3. Change your lightbulbs
4. Drive less and drive smarter
5. Buy Energy-Efficient Products6. 
6. Use Less Hot Water
8. Plant a Tree or two
10. Encourage Others to Conserve
